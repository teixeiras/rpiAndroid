        summary="Overdraw: Painting regions more than once"
        explanation="If you set a background drawable on a root view, then you should use a custom theme where the theme background is null. Otherwise, the theme background will be painted first, only to have your custom background completely cover it; this is called &quot;overdraw&quot;.

NOTE: This detector relies on figuring out which layouts are associated with which activities based on scanning the Java code, and it&apos;s currently doing that using an inexact pattern matching algorithm. Therefore, it can incorrectly conclude which activity the layout is associated with and then wrongly complain that a background-theme is hidden.

If you want your custom background on multiple pages, then you should consider making a custom theme with your custom background and just using that theme instead of a root element background.

Of course it&apos;s possible that your custom drawable is translucent and you want it to be mixed with the background. However, you will get better performance if you pre-mix the background with your drawable and use that resulting image or color as a custom theme background instead.

On older platforms, where RTL is not supported and the start/right attributes are unknown and therefore ignored, you need the older left/right attributes. There is a separate lint check which catches that type of error.
(Note: For `Gravity#LEFT` and `Gravity#START`, you can use these constants even when targeting older platforms, because the `start` bitmask is a superset of the `left` bitmask. Therefore, you can use `gravity=&quot;start&quot;` rather than `gravity=&quot;left|start&quot;`.)"

        severity="Warning"
        message="Consider adding `android:layout_toEndOf=&quot;@+id/menuButton&quot;` to better support right-to-left layouts"
        category="Bi-directional Text"
        priority="5"
        summary="Using left/right instead of start/end attributes"
        explanation="Using `Gravity#LEFT` and `Gravity#RIGHT` can lead to problems when a layout is rendered in locales where text flows from right to left. Use `Gravity#START` and `Gravity#END` instead. Similarly, in XML `gravity` and `layout_gravity` attributes, use `start` rather than `left`.
For XML attributes such as paddingLeft and `layout_marginLeft`, use `paddingStart` and `layout_marginStart`. *NOTE*: If your `minSdkVersion` is less than 17, you should add *both* the older left/right attributes *as well as* the new start/right attributes. On older platforms, where RTL is not supported and the start/right attributes are unknown and therefore ignored, you need the older left/right attributes.

ECLIPSE ANDROID PROJECT IMPORT SUMMARY
======================================

Ignored Files:
--------------
The following files were *not* copied into the new Gradle project; you
should evaluate whether these are still needed in your project and if
so manually move them:

* .gitattributes
* .gitignore
* LICENSE
* README
* ant.properties
* build.xml
* connectbot.sublime-project
* locale/
* locale/.gitignore
* tests/
* tests/.classpath
* tests/.gitignore
* tests/.project
* tests/.settings/
* tests/.settings/org.eclipse.jdt.core.prefs
* tests/.settings/org.eclipse.jdt.ui.prefs
* tests/ant.properties
* tests/build.xml
* tests/proguard.cfg
* tests/project.properties

Moved Files:
------------
Android Gradle projects use a different directory structure than ADT
Eclipse projects. Here's how the projects were restructured:

* AndroidManifest.xml => connectbot/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml
* assets/ => connectbot/src/main/assets/
* jni/ => connectbot/src/main/jni/
* libs/armeabi/libcom_google_ase_Exec.so => connectbot/src/main/jniLibs/armeabi/libcom_google_ase_Exec.so
* libs/x86/libcom_google_ase_Exec.so => connectbot/src/main/jniLibs/x86/libcom_google_ase_Exec.so
* proguard.cfg => connectbot/proguard.cfg
* res/ => connectbot/src/main/res/
* src/ => connectbot/src/main/java/
* tests/src/ => connectbot/src/androidTest/java/

Next Steps:
-----------
You can now build the project. The Gradle project needs network
connectivity to download dependencies.

Bugs:
-----
If for some reason your project does not build, and you determine that
it is due to a bug or limitation of the Eclipse to Gradle importer,
please file a bug at http://b.android.com with category
Component-Tools.

(This import summary is for your information only, and can be deleted
after import once you are satisfied with the results.)
